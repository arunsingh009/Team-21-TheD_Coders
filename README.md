### Introduction 
<!--- Basically abstract of your project -->
CollegeBuddy is a platform where we are providing college students all the materials and courses in one place along with handwritten notes, for the sole purpose of learning & resolving their queries.  

Also, a place where the student or the new learner can connect with their Alumni and other Learned Users, where they'll help and solve all the queries related to placements and interviews.
